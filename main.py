# Pickle or whatever all day objs?
# Does it make sense to save these patches to disk?

# Converting Pytorch from Numpy doesn't require extra memory
# b = torch.from_numpy(a)
## ToTensor() transform will do this

# How to take the day_obj and split into train, dev, test?
## Hashing

# Use PIL (Python Image Library) instead of CV2? RGB vs BGR
## Probably not, we want to stack image s anyway

# torchvision.transforms.CenterCrop or RandomCrop will grab patch FROM A PIL IMAGE
## Not a PIL

# Can write your own transforms http://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/data_loading_tutorial.html
## Could use extract_patches_2d

# num_workers=1, pin_memory = true for GPU?  (see github link above) https://gist.github.com/kevinzakka/d33bf8d6c7f06a9d8c76d97a7879f5cb

# Could parallelize the load_images() in webcam_dataset
## No need for now since it's just strings.

# Should I stack images as 3D? or 4D?
